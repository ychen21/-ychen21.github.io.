## About me
I am a senior student graduting from UW Geography:DS track in this summer 2024. I am very passion about using the skills I learned in school to help the society. I love animals(cats, dogs, and wildlifes), staying at home(**MBTI**: INTP), playing video games and watch anime, and sleeping(*up to 18 hours*).
